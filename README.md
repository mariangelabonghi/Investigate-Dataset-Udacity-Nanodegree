# Investigate a dataset

This is the second project for the "Data Analyst" [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) Nanodegree where I analyzed the dataset "No-show appointments"

## Introduction

This dataset[1] collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

The investigation of the dataset will be focused on the following points:
- In the dataset we can see different characteristics about the patient such as hypertension, diabet, alcoholism, handicap, scholarship[2] and gender. There is also the information regarding the reception or not of an SMS used to remember the appointment to the patient. A first analisys is focused on which of mentioned characteristics majorly have impact on the fact that the patient showed up or not his appointment;
- The number of days between the day in which the appointment is fixed and the day of the appointment, can have an influence on fact that the patient showed up or not his appointment?
- Are there location[3] of the hospital that majorly involved on the missing appointments?
